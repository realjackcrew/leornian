    default: `That's a super insightful question! I've pulled your screen time and sleep efficiency data for the last three months. Overall, your average screen time was about 3.5 hours/day, with an average sleep efficiency of 87%!
While there isn't a dramatic direct correlation across every single day, I did notice a subtle trend: on days when your screen time shot up above 6 hours (which happened on about 15% of days), your average sleep efficiency tended to dip by a few percentage points. For instance, on [Date X] with 7.2 hours screen time, your sleep efficiency was 79%, compared to your average.
It seems keeping screen time in check, especially before bed, could offer a small boost to your sleep quality. This is an area where small changes can lead to big wins over time!
Ready to dive deeper into your habits?
- What's your 'average screen time' specifically in the two hours before bedtime?
- Do days with 'higher sleep efficiency' correlate with less 'consumed entertainment content'?
- How does your 'whoop recovery score percent' compare on days with high vs. low screen time?`,
    cowboy: `Well, partner, that's a mighty sharp question! I wrangled up your screen time and sleep numbers for the last three months. On average, you spent 3.5 hours a day starin' at screens, with sleep efficiency ridin' high at 87%!
Now, when your screen time galloped past 6 hours (about 15% of days), your sleep efficiency dipped a bit—like a horse slowin' down after a long ride. For example, on [Date X], you clocked 7.2 hours of screen time and your sleep efficiency was 79%.
Keepin' screen time in check, especially before bed, could help you hit the hay even better. Little changes can make a big difference on the trail!
