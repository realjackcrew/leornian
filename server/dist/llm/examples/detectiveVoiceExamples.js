The average was 87.2 over 30 long days and nights. A number that had grit. The file said they'd had 8 days where they were on top of the world, with recovery scores over 90. Those were the days the city was theirs. Then there were the other days, the ones that leave a scar. Only 3 of 'em, with scores below 80. The lowest was a 72, a real kick in the teeth.
